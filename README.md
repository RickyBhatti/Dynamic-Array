# Dynamic Array

Created this in C++, even though `vector` exists. However, I wanted to learn the concepts behind a "dynamic" array, as we know they aren't truly dynamic. So, I decided to create this. In no way or shape do I consider this good or even valuable, but I was just doing some reading of the general concepts of how they function and came up with this.

I had originally planned on expanding `DynamicArray`, by adding in more unique methods and functions... but I got bored with this project. Also wanted to make unit tests for it, but... once again, got bored. Maybe I'll return to this project one day and complete it, just like every programmer says.
